# Luar

Luar is a Lua interpreter implemented in Rust. It aims to provide a high-performance, reliable interpreter that supports as many Lua features as possible.

## Installation

To use Luar, you need to have Rust programming language and Cargo package manager installed. Please refer to [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for installation instructions.

Use the following command in the terminal to install Luar:

```shell
$ cargo install luar
```

**Note: Luar is still under active development and will soon be installable using the above command.**

## Usage

To run a Lua script, execute the following command:

```shell
$ luar script.lua
```

If you want to run an interactive Lua shell, execute the following command:

```shell
$ luar
```

This will open a Lua REPL(Read-Eval-Print Loop).
